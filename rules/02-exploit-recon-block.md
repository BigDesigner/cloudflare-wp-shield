# Rule 2 — Exploit & Recon Block

**Action:** Block

See the full expression in `ruleset-free-plan.md`.

## What it targets
- `.env`, configs, credential files, repo leaks (`/.git`)
- database dumps/backups (`.sql`, `.bak`, `.old`, `update.sql`)
- common webshell/diagnostic probes (`phpinfo`, `console.php`, `wso`, `c99`, `shell`)
- suspicious upload/admin endpoints often probed by bots
- random root `*.php` probing (excluding WordPress core paths)

## Built-in exclusions
This rule includes a basic allowlist to avoid accidental matches on common static assets:
CSS/JS/maps, images, fonts, and common document types.

## Customizing / Whitelisting
If you have legitimate root PHP endpoints (e.g., `/api.php`, `/gateway.php`), add `not contains` exceptions inside the `.php` block (see `docs/troubleshooting.md`).
