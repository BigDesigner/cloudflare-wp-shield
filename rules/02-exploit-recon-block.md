# Rule 2 — Exploit & Recon Block

**Action:** Block

See the full expression in `ruleset-free-plan.md`.

## What it targets
- `.env`, config, installer, backup/dump discovery attempts
- repo leaks (`/.git`)
- credential file hunting
- random root `*.php` probing (excluding WordPress core paths)
- double-slash bypass attempts

## Customizing
If you have legitimate root PHP endpoints, whitelist them (see `docs/troubleshooting.md`).
